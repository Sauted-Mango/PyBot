# **PyBot**

*A fairly simple Discord bot using Python3 and the discord.py (rewrite) library.*

**About this project:**

The main goal was to make a mostly lightweight and simple bot for our servers. 
There are by far better bots out there, but this is a fun project to work on never-the-less.

**Relevant Info:**
- only tested on Windows (10) so far
- there are plans for GNU Linux support (starting with Ubuntu) in the near future
- required libs:
  > - discord.py
  > - Fernet
  > - 

**Current Plans:**
- reduce external libraries down to 1 or 2 max (not main focus atm)
- better comments within the code
- "trim the fat"
- add ability for the optional GUI program (tkinter) to send commands to bot directly
- make 2nd script ensure bot doesn't close and fail to re-open, and add ability to restart at any point
-
